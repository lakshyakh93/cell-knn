#summary About the project.

= Introduction =

This project is part of the [https://orawww.uibk.ac.at/public_prod/owa/lfuonline_lv.details?lvnr_id_in=703701&sem_id_in=08W Praktikum f√ºr Verteilte und Parallele Systeme] course at the [http://uibk.ac.at University of Innsbruck], Austria. The team of this project implements a parallel version of the K-NN algorithm on IBM's Cell processor. To measure the performance of the implementation we classify hand written images contained in the [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ MNIST database].

= Presentation =

  * You can download the introduction presentation (in german) [http://cell-knn.googlecode.com/files/IntroductionPresentation.pdf here].
  * A presentation showing our schedule can be found [http://cell-knn.googlecode.com/files/Schedule.pdf here].

= Results =

Currently, two versions of the k-NN algorithm have been implemented:
 * [http://code.google.com/p/cell-knn/source/browse/#svn/trunk/Cell_kNN_v1 Cplusplu_kNN]: a _sequential_ implementation written in standard C++.
 * [http://code.google.com/p/cell-knn/source/browse/#svn/trunk/Cell_kNN_v1 Cell_kNN_v1]: a simple _parallel_ implementation written for the Cell BE.

See [CellKNNv1#Results] for more information.
