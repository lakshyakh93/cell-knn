#summary Description of Cell k-NN 2.0.

= Cell k-NN 2.0 =

Considering the results obtained from analyzing Cell k-NN 1.0, we want to realize the following optimizations:
 * Extend program to use SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) features, i.e. calculate distance of 4 dimensions in one cycle.
 * Implement pipelining approach as described in section [#Pipelining Pipelining] to avoid bottleneck when accessing data.
 * Implement different distribution paradigm (parallelization over test points).
