#summary Description of Cell k-NN 2.0.

= Cell k-NN 2.0 =

For version 2.0 of the k-NN implementation we are planning to
 * Analyze PPE and SPE usage (load balancing)
 * Implement different distribution paradigm
 * Implement different distance measures
 * Use [http://www.bsc.es/plantillaG.php?cat_id=179 Cell Superscalar] framework provided by Barcelona Supercomputer Center.
 * MARS - Multicore Application Runtime System.

Considering the results obtained from analyzing the Cell k-NN 1.0 version, we want to realize the following optimizations:
 * Extend program to use SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) features, i.e. calculate distance of 4 dimensions in one cycle.
 * Implement pipelining approach as described in section [CellKNNv2#Pipelining Pipelining].
