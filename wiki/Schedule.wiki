== Cell k-NN 1.0 ==

In the first version of the Cell k-NN program we are trying to implement a runnable program that distributes the work among the SPEs. Generally, there are two possibilities of how to accomplish this:
 * *Streaming*
 * *Pipeline*

We are still not sure, which way to choose, but the tendency goes towords the solution using "Pipelining". We are also considering using the [http://www.bsc.es/plantillaG.php?cat_id=179 Cell Superscalar] framework provided by Barcelona Supercomputer Center.
