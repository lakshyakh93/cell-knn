#summary Fedora 9 VMware-Image with Cell SDK.

= Introduction =

Software development for the cell microprocessor involves a mixture of conventional development practices for the POWER architecture-compatible PPU core, and novel software development challenges with regards to the functionally reduced SPU coprocessors.

= Details =

For making life easier we have created a Fedora 9 VMware image containing:
 * Cell SDK 3.1
 * Full Systemsimulator (Fedora 9)
 * Cell IDE for Eclipse (fixed "21% Kernel Loading" problem)
 * GNU-toolchain

The VMware image is compressed with "7z" and password protected.

= Download =

A [http://www.dps.uibk.ac.at/~csae6550/downloads/fedoradownloader.sh shell script] which downloads the compressed VMware image (divided into several parts) and merges the downloaded parts to a single .7z file can be download [http://www.dps.uibk.ac.at/~csae6550/downloads/fedoradownloader.sh here].
