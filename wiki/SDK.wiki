#summary Fedora 9 VMware-Image with Cell-SDK

= Introduction =

Software development for the cell microprocessor involves a mixture of conventional development practices for the POWER architecture-compatible PPU core, and novel software development challenges with regards to the functionally reduced SPU coprocessors.


= Details =

For making life easier we have created a Fedora 9 vmware-image (running under vmware-server 1.7) containing:
  * Cell SDK 3.1
  * Full Systemsimulator (Fedora 9)
  * Cell IDE for Eclipse (fixed "21% Kernel Loading" problem)
  * GNU-toolchain

The vmware-image is compressed with "7z" and password protection.
