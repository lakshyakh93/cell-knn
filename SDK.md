# Introduction #

Software development for the cell microprocessor involves a mixture of conventional development practices for the POWER architecture-compatible PPU core, and novel software development challenges with regards to the functionally reduced SPU coprocessors.

# Details #

For making life easier we have created a Fedora 9 VMware image containing:
  * Cell SDK 3.1
  * Full Systemsimulator (Fedora 9)
  * Cell IDE for Eclipse (fixed "21% Kernel Loading" problem)
  * GNU-toolchain

You can use the following Linux accounts:
  * User: cell PW: cell
  * User: root PW: cellsdk

The VMware image is compressed with "7z" and password protected.

# Download #

The download of the VMware image is no longer available.
